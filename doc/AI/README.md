# AI
This folder contains information regarding AIs.

External AIs are located in the `AI` folder. As we do not want to spoil the fun of developing an AI for yourself, no AIs shall get pushed to GitHub.
To still be able to use source control for the AIs, the AIs shall be commited in a seperate branch called 'AI', which won't be commited to GitHub.
Once *The Eventâ„¢* is over, we can merge this branch into the master branch and make it available for everyone.

The same applies for AIs in the com.smeanox.games.sg002.player package. The only exception are the sample AIs as they serve as an example.
They shall only demonstrate how to use the API, but not perform a "real" strategy.

See [Protocol.md](Protocol.md) for more information about external AIs.
